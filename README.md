This repository contains the code examples from the additional exercises book.
There are several ways you can work with the code:

* You can create a copy of this repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.
After forking, you'll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write.
Then you can "clone" the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.

* Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking.
If you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you won't be able to save your changes on GitHub.

To clone a repository, you need Git installed on your computer (see https://help.github.com/).
If you use Git from the command line, you can clone the original repository like this:

    git clone https://github.com/jdeisenberg/ThinkJava2ExCode.git

After you clone the repository or unzip the ZIP file, you should have a directory named `ThinkJava2ExCode` with a subdirectory for each chapter in the book that contains sample code.

The examples in this book were developed and tested using OpenJDK 16.
If you are using a more recent version, everything should still work.
If you are using an older version, some of the examples might not.
